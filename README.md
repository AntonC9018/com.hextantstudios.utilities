# Hextant - Utilities

This repository contains a collection of helpful runtime and editor classes for Unity. 

## Package Manager Installation

It can be installed from Unity's *Package Manager* using the following Git URL:

* [https://github.com/hextantstudios/com.hextantstudios.utilities.git](https://github.com/hextantstudios/com.hextantstudios.utilities.git)

## Embedded Installation

It can also be installed by cloning this repository into a Unity project's `Packages/` folder. This will allow changes to be made to the package, but updates will need to be done manually using Git instead of Unity's *Package Manager*.

## Documentation

Documentation for the classes can be found below and in various articles on [HextantStudios.com](https://HextantStudios.com).
